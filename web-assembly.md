# Notes on WebAssembly

I have learned about Webassembly just a few days ago inspired by the title of following article:

**WebAssembly and The Death of the App Store**

## What is WebAssembly?

According to WikiPedia:

    WebAssembly or wasm is an experimental efficient low-level programming language for in-browser client-side scripting, which is currently in development. WebAssembly is portable bytecode which is designed to be faster to parse than JavaScript, as well as faster to execute.

## What is Emscripten?

    Emscripten is a type of source-to-source compiler that runs as a back end to the LLVM compiler and produces a subset of JavaScript known as asm.js.
